# NEXUS_AI

This project aims to build a revolutionize hiring process with integrating AL. The solution leverages an LLM (Large Language Model) integrated with the backend for tasks such as resume parsing, generating interview questions and assesing candidate with his skillset through virtual AI interview. However, due to certain limitations, the frontend could not be fully integrated with the backend.

## Project Overview

- **Backend**: The backend of this project is fully functional and hosts the LLM model. It handles tasks such as RAG implementation and fetching questions through APIs.
- **Frontend**: The frontend was designed to provide a user-friendly interface for interaction with the backend. However, due to multiple bugs and complexity at the final stages, the frontend could not be integrated successfully with the backend.
  
## Current Status

- **LLM Model**: The LLM model is working flawlessly and has been successfully integrated with the backend. It is capable of performing desired tasks.
  
- **Backend Integration**: The backend exposes APIs for interacting with the LLM model. This integration has been thoroughly tested and is stable.

- **Frontend**: Although the frontend was developed, its integration with the backend encountered significant issues, including several bugs and architectural complexity. As a result, the frontend remains unlinked to the backend.

## How to Run the Backend

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `backend` folder and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file for setting up the backend.
3. Once the backend is running, you can interact with the APIs provided by the LLM model.

## Future Plans

In the future, we aim to resolve the issues in the frontend-backend integration and provide a seamless user experience. Contributions and suggestions for improving the project are welcome.
